Creation of a paint window in Java.

In this window, you can add and remove squares and circles. 
You can also sort them by size in the window.

Here is an explanation...

This is the window empty at the beginning of the program :

By selecting "Square" shape and clicking the "+" button, you then get a square on the window

You can then add several other square from randomly both different size and different color

Finally, by clicking the "Sort" button, it sorts every square from the smallest size to the largest one

Moreover, everytime you press the "-" button, it's going to remove from the smallest to the largest, shape by shape, from the window

You can also either do the same thing with circles mixed with squares by using the "Circle" button

Or you can do it with squares only
